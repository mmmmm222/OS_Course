- Illusion of a Dedicated CPU :

    Each process behaves as if it has its own CPU, even though it shares the actual physical CPU with other processes.

- Illusion of Dedicated Memory :

    Each process operates as if it has its own large, contiguous block of memory, separate from other processes' memory.

This Also Called 'Virtualization'

So If There Are Two Processes Running At The Same Time Also We Have Just One Core We Might see The Have Different PID Put The Memory Address Is The Same
